## About Me

![Me circa 2010]({static}/images/photo.jpg)

"Helio was an 8-year-old boy who got hold of a computer and never let go." Programming was my first foreign language, English being a distant second; today it feels like second nature. After getting my B.Sc. in Computer Science I spent the next ten years or so working in enterprise IT, before returning to academia for research in robotics and artificial vision. Currently I'm working in the robotics industry, developing mobile robot navigation software.

## Favourite Links

* [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/) - "Biting the hand that feeds IT". A news portal on technology, natural sciences, economy and law, (almost) always with a view to the IT field – and an occasional bit of tinkering and silliness on the side. Easily the sharpest wordsmiths in the IT reporting arena.
* [Rewiring Neuroscience](http://www.rewiring-neuroscience.com/) - Probably my favorite science book. Starting with a startling assumption – that contrary to conventional wisdom, individual neuron spikes can somehow transmit meaningful information from one neuron to the next – author John Harris brings together a number of overlooked experimental results into a surprisingly feasible theory of how the brain works.
* [Atomic Insights](http://atomicinsights.com) - Among other indiscretions, I am an atomic power apologist. Rod Adams maintains my favorite blog on nuclear energy science and industry. Posts are sometimes dry, focused on legal and political issues, but they always give good insights on the challenges and perspectives of the field.
* [The Gervais Principle](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/) - Venkatesh Rao's account of human nature, social order and organizational dynamics is a must-read, even if you've never watched <i>The Office</i> – I for one didn't, and still this is one of my all-time favorite books.
