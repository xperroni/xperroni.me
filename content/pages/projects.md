Title: Projects

This is a short list of open-source projects I have published. Some haven't seen updates in quite some time, but all were used in research and/or production at some point and should remain usable.

## Luffer

[https://github.com/xperroni/luffer](https://github.com/xperroni/luffer)

Luffer is a tool to create isolated environments for software development and execution. Containers are seamlessly integrated to the host environment as they are instantiated, making possible to keep project files and general-purpose applications (such as text editor and version control clients) on the host, while project-specific tools and files are stored in the image. Multiple development environments with otherwise conflicting dependencies can therefore coexist in the same host.

## CV Video

CV Video integrates OpenCV's video recording and replaying API's to ROS.

## PyShed

[https://github.com/xperroni/PySHed](https://github.com/xperroni/PySHed)

PySHed simplifies access to shell commands and command-line applications from within Python scripts.

## rostweet

The rostweet package provides a bridge between ROS nodes and the Twitter microblogging service.

## Terminal I/O

[https://github.com/xperroni/terminal_io](https://github.com/xperroni/terminal_io)

Terminal I/O enables ROS nodes to communicate with external terminal sessions.
